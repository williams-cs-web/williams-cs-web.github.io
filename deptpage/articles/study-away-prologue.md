Many CS majors elect to participate in a study away program (for general details on study away programs at Williams, go [here](https://study-away.williams.edu/). With approval from the department, some of the courses taken during study away (up to two CSCI courses and one MATH course) may be used to satisfy the CS major requirements. You cannot receive credit for the same material twice (i.e., If you take Machine Learning abroad, you cannot take it at Williams.) Pre-vetted courses (and the CS major requirements that they are eligible to satisfy) are available here:
