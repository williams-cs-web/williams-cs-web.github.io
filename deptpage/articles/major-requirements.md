Full official details of our major requirements can be found [here](https://catalog.williams.edu/pdf/csci.pdf), but the following is a gentle summary.
A computer science major must complete 8 CSCI courses and 2 MATH courses (in addition to satisfying the broader Williams College graduation requirements). These courses must include the following:

* the introductory sequence: CSCI 134 and CSCI 136
* the core courses: CSCI 237, CSCI 256, and either CSCI 334 or CSCI 361
* one of the following "discrete math" courses: MATH 200, MATH 328, MATH 334, MATH 341
* a math course at the 200-or-above level (i.e. MATH 2xx or MATH 3xx) that was not used to satisfy the above requirement
* at least three CSCI courses at the 300-or-above level, not including CSCI 39x courses or any courses used to satisfy the above requirements

The CSCI 134 requirement is waived for students that have gotten a 4+ on the AP Computer Science A Exam or who pass our CS Placement Exam (sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqGhIktPZ8HS1FMCepOhiPGR3Tiax7s2hwEbbJEobH3IMoow/viewform)). In this case, the student needs to take an additional CSCI course to bring their total up to 8. This situation corresponds to the "accelerated" path in the Major Planning Assistant below.

In addition, all computer science majors must attend a total of at least twenty sessions of the Computer Science Colloquium, a regular series of computer science talks typically held Fridays 235-350pm in Wege Auditorium (TCL 123). Juniors and seniors are encouraged to attend at least five during each semester they are present on campus.  Prospective majors in their first and second years are also encouraged to attend.
