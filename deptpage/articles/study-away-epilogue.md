If a particular course does not appear above, and you would like to use that course to satisfy a CS major requirement, then you must get pre-approval from the department before attending your study away program. To get pre-approval, email Mark Hopkins with a syllabus and course description.
           
To obtain credit for pre-approved courses upon completion of the study away program, fill out this [form](https://study-away.williams.edu/returning-students/study-away-evaluation/) for the Williams College Global Education and Study Away Office.
           
Finally, a student will receive four colloquium credits for each semester away, up to a total of eight credits.
