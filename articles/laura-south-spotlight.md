Starting this fall, Laura South will be joining the Williams CS department as a Visiting Professor for the 2024-2025 school year. Laura joins us from Northeastern University, where she recently completed her PhD under the supervision of Michelle Borkin. Laura’s area is human-computer interaction, with a focus on accessible computing, in particular, on developing tools and techniques to safeguard web users who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy. Laura will be teaching our introductory computer science course, CSCI 134, and she will also be putting her own spin on CSCI 376: Human-Computer Interaction.

We are excited to have Laura join us, and we asked Laura to tell us a little about herself.

**How did you become interested in CS? Or in your area of study specifically?**

I took a bit of a circuitous route to CS! When I was younger I was always drawn towards classes that emphasized reading and writing and wasn’t as interested in math and science courses. This changed in college when I took my first statistics course and fell in love with the logical and practical nature of the subject. I took a CS class to fulfill a requirement for my statistics degree and was surprised to find that I really enjoyed solving the problems in each programming assignment! Once I discovered CS research as a career path and the sub-field of human-computer interaction, I knew I had found a way to combine my love for reading, writing, and thinking critically about the systems around me with my newfound interest in programming and CS. The rest is history!

**What do you hope to bring to Williams Computer Science Department?**

I am excited to bring my passion for human-centered design and accessibility research to the Williams Computer Science Department! I’m thrilled to be teaching courses on Human-Computer Interaction in the spring and the fall and helping out with intro courses in the spring.

**What are some of your favorite things?**

There’s so much to choose from, but lately I have been particularly appreciating my collection of house plants, lap swimming at my local Y, watching the equestrian events at the Olympics, and building miniature model kits!

**Are you excited about any specific aspect of living in the Berkshires or working at Williams?**

I am very excited to return to a slower, more rural-adjacent style of living after six years of being in Boston. I hope to spend a good amount of time outside in nature while I am at Williams, particularly hiking and birdwatching.
