Williams has recently been able to provide a number of summer positions for students wishing to assist faculty in their research. In recent summers 50 to 100 students have been employed as research assistants in the sciences. Student research assistants are provided with a stipend, and are able to obtain reduced rates for room and board at the college for the summer. These research assistant positions make it possible for many students to get a head start on an honors thesis. Others use this as an opportunity to get a more intense introduction to their intended major.
