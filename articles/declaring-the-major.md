You are eligible to declare the CS major once you have completed two CSCI courses (including CSCI 136) and MATH 200 (or a more advanced replacement, specifically MATH 328, 334, or 341).

Once you have done so (typically by the end of your second year at Williams), proceed with the following steps:

- Fill out a major planning worksheet (available [here](http://sysnet.cs.williams.edu/~jeannie/advising/cs-planning-sheet-s24.pdf)), along with a transcript. If you plan to double-major, be aware that Williams College does not permit a single course to satisfy two different major requirements. For this reason, our department provides specialized planning sheets for students planning to double-major in either [Math](http://sysnet.cs.williams.edu/~jeannie/advising/cs-math-planning-sheet-s24.pdf) or [Statistics](http://sysnet.cs.williams.edu/~jeannie/advising/cs-stat-planning-sheet-s24.pdf).
- Once the major planning worksheet has been submitted, meet with a CS faculty member during pre-registration. To facilitate this process, the department will announce an advising schedule shortly before pre-registration.
- After the meeting, go [here](https://williamscollege.formstack.com/forms/declare_major) to complete the "Declare Major" form for the Williams College Registrar.
- Welcome to the CS Major! ðŸŽˆ
